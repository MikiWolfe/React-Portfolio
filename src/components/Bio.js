        I love animals, reading, going for hikes, playing video
        games and tabletop games. Problem solving is the main reason that I
        sparked an interest in learning how to code. I am an ernest communicator and can work independently or 
        with a group to create a MVP. 
        I am still a licensed veterinary technician and have been for the last 6 years and worked in
        the veterinary field for 11 years. I love learning new things and have
        a passion for technology and learning how things work. Fun fact about
        myself: I ran an MRI on a bear cub and got my shoelaces untied
        by a sea otter.
